Code 201 - Project

Ran into an issue under Console where my linked css pages and js page was 404: not found. I learned that was the case as the linked .css pages were under a different folder or path, and in my HTML code, I needed to reference where that file was in relation to the folder it was in.

I used information from this site to fix this issue I was having.
