      <section><p id="pwelcome">Welcome y'all! My name is Christopher and I am originally from Dallas, TX but recently transplanted to Seattle, specifically the Belltown neighborhood, with my wife a little over two months ago.
      <br><br>Prior to joining Code Fellows, I was in the finance sector for about 3 years, including retail sales management and in the retail banking side of finance. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, I knew the financial sales world was not for me long-term, even though that's what I earned my undergraduate degree in. I spoke with a couple of my friends who have been in tech for a number of years now and they all alleviated my longstanding concerns getting into tech, mainly that you don't have to be an expert in everything computers, hardware, software, IT, electronics, etc.
      <br><br>I love to snowboard, travel abroad and explore our own "backyard." And I am so honored that you. Yes! You! Have visited my About Me page.</p>
